## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on MNIST Dataset
### Project Overview
This project involved training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on the MNIST dataset. The process began with pre-processing the MNIST data to normalize and shape it appropriately for training. Custom generator and discriminator neural networks were defined, each playing a crucial role in the adversarial training setup. The generator aimed to produce realistic images of handwritten digits from random noise, while the discriminator worked to distinguish between real MNIST images and those generated by the generator. Binary cross-entropy was used as the loss function to guide the training process, ensuring the generator improved its ability to create convincing digit images while the discriminator honed its capability to differentiate real from synthetic samples.
### GAN Structure
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed to generate synthetic data that closely resembles real data. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. Here’s a detailed explanation of each component and the overall structure:
#### 1. Generator
   - Purpose: The generator’s goal is to create realistic data samples from random noise.
   - Input: Random noise (typically drawn from a Gaussian distribution).
   - Output: Synthetic data that mimics the real data.
   - Architecture: A neural network that maps the random noise to data space (e.g., images, text).
#### 2. Discriminator
   - Purpose: The discriminator’s goal is to distinguish between real data samples and the synthetic samples generated by the generator.
   - Input: Both real data samples and synthetic samples from the generator.
   - Output: A probability score indicating the likelihood that a given sample is real (close to 1) or fake (close to 0).
   - Architecture: A neural network that takes a data sample and outputs a single scalar value (the probability score).
#### 3. Training Process
#### Adversarial Training
The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a minimax game:
   - Generator Objective: To generate samples that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real data. It tries to maximize the discriminator’s error rate (i.e., it wants the discriminator to classify its synthetic samples as real).
   - Discriminator Objective: To correctly classify real and synthetic samples. It tries to minimize the classification error.
#### Loss Functions
  - Generator Loss: Encourages the generator to produce more realistic samples. It is typically defined using binary cross-entropy loss with labels flipped (to make the discriminator’s job harder).
  - Discriminator Loss: Encourages the discriminator to correctly classify real versus fake samples. It is also defined using binary cross-entropy loss.
#### 4. Overall Workflow
#### Initialization: 
Start with random weights for both the generator and the discriminator.
#### Training Loop:
  - Step 1: Generate a batch of fake samples using the generator.
  - Step 2: Combine these with a batch of real samples.
  - Step 3: Train the discriminator on this combined batch, labeling the real samples as real and the fake samples as fake.
  - Step 4: Train the generator by passing fake samples through the discriminator and computing the loss as if these samples were real. The generator’s weights are updated to minimize this loss.
  - Repeat: Continuously repeat the above steps, iteratively improving both networks.
#### 5. Convergence
The training process continues until the generator produces sufficiently realistic data that the discriminator can no longer easily distinguish between real and fake samples. Ideally, this results in a balance where both networks are equally strong.
